# aventOfCode solutions


I have tried to note in the code when I used either existing solutions in the Reddit threads to help with solutions or to bug fix. For the majority of the solutions (all but a handful), the solutions are completely my own without any hints at all.

As my goal is two fold: 
- First to try and be creative in solving the problems
- Second to understand new algorithms and approaches

Because of this, there are a handful of examples where either I used other people's improved algorithms (ie brute force vs an elogent solution) because the second part of the problem required a non-brute force solution. Also, I sometimes included my own solution and another solution (again I tried to include a link to a repo or at least Advent username for who presented original code) to help widen by programming understanding.
