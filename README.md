# aventOfCode solutions


I have tried to note in the code when I used either existing solutions in the Reddit threads to help with solutions or to bug fix. For the majority of the solutions (all but a handful), the solutions are completely my own without any hints at all.

My goals are two fold: 
- First to try and be creative in solving the problems
- Second, if unsuccessful, to understand new algorithms and approaches

Because of this, there are a few cases where I switched to other people's improved algorithms to further my learning. Also, in cases where I thought the problem was interesting but didn't know how to solve it, I would occassionally try to download someones part 1 solution in hopes of understanding it and then applying the logic to part 2.
